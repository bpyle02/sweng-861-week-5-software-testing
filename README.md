# Software Testing

- GitHub Repo can be found here: [https://github.com/bpyle02/sweng-861-week-5-software-testing](https://github.com/bpyle02/sweng-861-week-5-software-testing)

## Setting up the Environment

- The environment I am using is MERN (MongoDB, Express JS, React, and Node JS), however, I have added some extra goodies to make things a little easier
  - Vite — A usability tool to make building the frontend super easy
  - Tailwind CSS — A usability tool to make designing the UI super simple and easy
- To run this web app locally, clone the repository and run `npm i` in the frontend and backend folders
- After the frontend and backend are initialized, you can start up the backend by typing `npm start` in the terminal and the frontend by executing the `npm run dev` command
- You will then be able to access the website from [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). Right now, the website only has functionality to sign in, sign out, and edit your profile, but if you would like to see the fully built application, you can check out [https://christisking.info](https://christisking.info)
- You can also view the API documentation, built with Swagger UI, [http://localhost:3173/api-docs](http://localhost:3173/api-docs)
